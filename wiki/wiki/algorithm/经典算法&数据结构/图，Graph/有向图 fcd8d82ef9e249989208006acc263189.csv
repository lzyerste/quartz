Code,Description,其他
Digraph.py,有向图的表示,
DirectedDFS.py,"Single-source reachability. Given a digraph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from s to a given target vertex v?","单点出发可达性问题，同时也使用多点出发。
Multiple-source reachability. Given a digraph and a set of source vertices, sup- port queries of the form Is there a directed path from any vertex in the set to a given target vertex v?"
DepthFirstDirectedPaths.py,"Single-source directed paths. Given a digraph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from s to a given target vertex v? If so, find such a path.",单点出发到其他节点的路径
BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.py,"Single-source shortest directed paths. Given a digraph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from s to a given target vertex v? If so, find a shortest such path (one with a minimal number of edges).",单点出发到其他节点的最短路径
DirectedCycle.py,"Directed cycle detection. Does a given digraph have a directed cycle? If so, find the vertices on some such cycle, in order from some vertex back to itself.",有向图中环的检测
DepthFirstOrder.py,生成访问记录，包括前序、后序及后序的逆。,
Topological.py,"Topological sort. Given a digraph, put the vertices in order such that all its directed edges point from a ver- tex earlier in the order to a vertex later in the order (or report that doing so is not possible).",有向图的拓扑排序，依赖DirectedCycle来检测是否有环。依赖DepthFirstOrder来生成访问的后序逆。
KosarajuSCC.py,"Strong connectivity. Given a digraph, support queries of the form: Are two given vertices strongly connected ? and How many strong components does the digraph have ?","强连通体的生成。
依赖DepthFirstOrder来生成访问的后序逆。"
TransitiveClosure,"All-pairs reachability. Given a digraph, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from a given vertex v to another given vertex w?",有向图中，任意两点，是否可达。
