[Candy - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

## 题意

There are *N* children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

What is the minimum candies you must give?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
             The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

```

## 思路

1. 初始化时，大家都分配一颗糖果。然后从左往右扫描，分数比左邻居高的，糖果要比左邻居要多1颗；接着从右往左扫描，修复右邻居情况，注意糖果数量只能增不能减。

## 题解

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        res = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        # from left to right, look at the left neighbor
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                res[i] = res[i-1] + 1
        # from right to left, look at the right neighbor
        # in this progress, the left part is always ok
        for i in reversed(range(n - 1)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                res[i] = max(res[i], res[i+1] + 1)
        return sum(res)
```
