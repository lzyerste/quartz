[Transpose File - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-file/)

## 题意

Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

**Example:**

If `file.txt` has the following content:

```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30

```

Output the following:

```
name alice ryan
age 21 30

```

## 思路

## 题解

```python
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
awk '
{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        if(NR == 1) {
            s[i] = $i;
        } else {
            s[i] = s[i] " " $i;
        }
    }
}
END {
    for (i = 1; s[i] != ""; i++) {
        print s[i];
    }
}' file.txt
```
