## 题意

SQL Schema

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+

```

For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+

```

**Important Note:** For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example **`Rank`**.

## 思路

## 题解

```python
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Score as score, dense_rank() over (order by Score desc) as 'Rank' from Scores;
```
