[Course Schedule - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

## 题意

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [1,0](1,0)
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [1,0](1,0)
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

```

**Constraints:**

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

## 思路

1. 有向图环的检测，DFS或入度拓扑排序。

## 题解1：DFS

```python
WHITE = 0
GRAY = 1
BLACK = 2

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        from collections import defaultdict
        G = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(numCourses):
            G[i] = list()
        for u, v in prerequisites:
            G[v].append(u)
        
        has_cycle = False

        def dfs(G, u):
            nonlocal has_cycle
            C[u] = GRAY
            for v in G[u]:
                if C[v] == GRAY:
                    has_cycle = True
                    return
                if C[v] == WHITE:
                    dfs(G, v)
            C[u] = BLACK
        
        C = {u: WHITE for u in G}  # Color
        for u in G:
            if C[u] == WHITE:
                dfs(G, u)
        
        return not has_cycle
```

## 题解2：拓扑排序

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        :type numCourses: int
        :type prerequisites: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        n = numCourses
        pre = prerequisites
        G = {}
        for u in range(n):
            G[u] = set()
        for u, v in pre:
            G[v].add(u)
        return self.topo_bfs(G)[0]

    def topo_bfs(self, G):
        from collections import deque, defaultdict
        degree = defaultdict(int)
        for u in G:
            for v in G[u]:
                degree[v] += 1
        P = [u for u in G if degree[u] == 0]
        Q = deque(P)
        while Q:
            u = Q.popleft()
            for v in G[u]:
                degree[v] -= 1
                if degree[v] == 0:
                    P.append(v)
                    Q.append(v)
        return len(P) == len(G), P
```
