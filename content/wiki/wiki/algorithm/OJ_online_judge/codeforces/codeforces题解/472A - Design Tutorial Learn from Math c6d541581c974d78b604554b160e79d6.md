> And another way is try to prove this theorem. The prove is simple: if n is odd number, then 9 and (n-9) is an answer (n-9 is an even number at least 4, so a composite number), and if n is even number, then 8 and (n-8) is an answer (n-8 is an even number at least 4, also must be a composite number).
