# AMD机器cpufreq看不到

BIOS问题？

[Bug #1856440 "cpufreq: no or unknown cpufreq driver" : Bugs : linux package : Ubuntu](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1856440)

```cpp
Found out the problem. It was indeed a firmware update with my BIOS which disabled a power-on-demand item in the ACPI. Closing this.
```
